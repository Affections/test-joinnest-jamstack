f_about: >-
  "Group Agilis's (Agilis Advisors & Agilis Capital) Founder & CEO, I’m an
  investment banking and technology innovator, having catapulted Agilis from an
  idea to 8 digit (€) GTV and 7 digit (€) profits within the first two years of
  operations. Under my supervision, the firm currently manages over €3Billion in
  mandated transactions, spanning across the globe. My story and success in
  capital raising has been featured in high profile publications such as
  TechCrunch, Business Insider, Berlin valley, etc. Prior to Agilis, I was part
  of the founding team at Finiata (7 digit seed funding, 8 digit refinancing
  line). Previously, I founded MinRP.com (exited). On one hand I have built my
  own ventures from scratch, scaling them to seven-digit sales in the first
  year, on the other I have also contributed to the success of MNCs and
  start-ups: I was the Chief Product Officer at Lendico (acquired by ING Diba)
  and the Head of Product at Kreditech, where I led the product teams, executing
  a series of strategic initiatives across the lending products at Kreditech,
  playing a pivotal role in closing a US$103 million Series C funding round.
  Before Kreditech, I was handling product initiatives for 10+ product lines,
  contributing to annual sales > € 1 Billion, at Amazon. I’m also an active
  early stage investor, investing and advising startups, and actively mentor
  startups in venture programs such as EIT, Cocoon & Startupbootcamp. I was
  selected as one of the finalists (top 10 – pan EU) for the Digital Masters
  Awards."
