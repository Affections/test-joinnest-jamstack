f_about: >-
  "I graduated Magna Cum Laude with honors from Boston University with Majors in
  Psychology and Philosophy. I received my Master’s degree and Ph.D. in clinical
  psychology in 1986 from the University of Connecticut. Over the years, I’ve
  done post-doctoral training in family therapy and group therapy. In 1990, I
  began post-doctoral training in Organizational Development and Consulting at
  the W. A. White Institute. With a background in family therapy and
  organizational consulting, working with family businesses was a natural next
  step once I had my post-doctoral certificate. I’m an expert on families,
  families in business, and work-life balance. As a business consultant, I have
  worked for several large consulting firms throughout my career including RHR
  International, Hay Group (now part of Korn Ferry), and Hildebrandt (now owned
  by Thomson Reuters). I was also CEO of a human capital consultancy which was
  eventually sold to BNA, now part of Bloomberg LLP. Currently, I manage my own
  consultancy, Sirkin Advisors, a management consulting firm specializing in
  executive development, coaching, and organizational change
  (www.SirkinAdvisors.com ). I’m a senior/board level advisor to several
  companies including Buddha Booths, Assured Cyber Protection, and the
  Mediscan/Gamayan family of companies. I’m currently considered an expert in
  the burgeoning field of cyber psychology and human factors. I’m married with
  three adult children and live with my wife in White Plains, NY. I have written
  numerous articles and two books, The Secret Life of Corporations:
  Understanding the True Nature of Business (2004; 2nd Edition, 2020) and Regain
  Your Balance: At Work, with Family, in Life (2016). I’ve taught at the
  graduate level at the University of Rochester, CUNY, NYU, Yeshiva University,
  and most recently as Associate Professor, Director of the Mental Health
  Training Program, Chair of the Counseling Department, and Associate Dean of
  the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Mercy College in New York. I’m
  currently the immediate Past-President of the Society of Consulting
  Psychology, Division 13 of the American Psychological Association."
