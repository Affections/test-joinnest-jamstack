  clients an exemplary service,evidenced by outstanding feedback. I ensures that
  I create a culture of psychological safety in which my clients feel free to

  psychology interventions, I enable clients to connect, grow, thrive, and
  flourish.  
    
  I have been an invited guest on several podcasts, webinars, guest panels and
  BBC News where I have been able to discuss wellbeing and its importance. I
  have held several national leadership roles and am an active advocate for
  peers, currently holding Co-Chairship of a national doctors group.  
    
  I contribute my experience to volunteering. Most recently I founded a
  successful wellbeing scheme for a local hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic
  which gained increasing popularity and national attention. I was presented
