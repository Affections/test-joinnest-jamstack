  "Hi, my name is Sheela Hobden and I am an expert Coach who successfully helps
  people give as much attention to themselves as to those they serve (business
  or personal!). My style is challenging yet supportive, holding a safe space
  for you to explore your conundrums and secure the path onwards & upwards.
  People who work with me culminate with greater clarity, potential, purpose,
  and passion in their careers as well as at home. With a boost in confidence,
  professional growth & an optimised work-life balance, one is able to transcend
  the limits of a monotonous state of mind and hence find answers to be able to
  prioritise self-care. True leaders inspire excellence and grow themselves,
  their families, and organisations in which they operate. Over my years of
  coaching, I have been able to help people develop a positive outlook, gain a
  better sense of control, improve their boundaries between work and home as
  well as take on more activities and peacefully sleep better hence ensuring a
  promoted sense of well-being. My credentials include PCC (Professional
  Certified Coach) membership of the International Coaching Federation, endorsed
  WRAW (Workplace Resilience And Wellbeing) practitioner, whilst also being

  and facilitating evidence based, innovative programmes I provide one to one
  and group sessions. My extensive corporate background and recent programmes
  with proven results have been in healthcare settings. I have a unique &

  helping smart people like you get ahead of the game, as a Mentor Coach; I also
  partner with other coaches to sharpen their skills, grow the profession, and
