f_about: >-
  "Hello, I am Harsha, an entrepreneur and startup innovation speacialist based
  in Berlin, Germany. I am a strong advocate for sustainability and empowering
  women at the workplace. During the last 10 years, I have faced and conquered
  several challenges such as high pressure jobs, moving overseas, working in a
  gender-biased work enviornment, creating a family and transitioning into a
  working entrepreneur under the shadow of a pandemic. If my journey sounds
  relatable and you're looking to share your experience/situation to a
  sympathetic ear, I offer you a safe, non judgemental space. I can share how I
  overcame such issues, and even if our respective circumstances aren't similar,
  we can always explore options together. As mentioned above, I can offer
  support in various matters, including but not limited to: workspace
  transitions, entrepreneurship, founder issues, gender roles, workspace
  navigation, postpartum transition to work and more."
