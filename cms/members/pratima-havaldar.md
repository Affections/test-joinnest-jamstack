f_about: >-
  "I’m a practicing psychologist and counselor working in the field of Applied
  Psychology since the past four decades. With a Masters in Psychology from the
  University of Mumbai and a Certificate in Applied Psychology from TISS, my
  practice as a Consulting Psychologist spans over various domains like
  Research, Clinical work, Organizational Behaviour Training and Education. My
  sustained work as a counselor makes me proficient in working with persons of
  varied ages and life stages from diverse social backgrounds. Besides being a
  counselor, I’ve got a unique strong suit in designing psycho-educational
  learning programs in an experiential manner. My love for human beings and a
  deep sense of social responsibility made me work with various Governmental and
  Non-governmental organizations. I started my career as a Youth Employment
  officer with the Government of Maharashtra. I was instrumental in setting up a
  “Psychological Unit” as a Deputy Director of Psychological Services with the
  Ministry of Community Development in Singapore, where I worked for 6 years.
  Multiple certifications like those in MBTI, EQ-i2 and EQ 360 etc. breathe life
  into the Managerial Development and Behavioural training programs that I
  personalize for Organizations- allowing them to maximize their potential. As a
  facilitator of People Development, my sustained engagement with Organizations
  in various sectors merges my understanding of EQ with my unique interpersonal
  insights. I’m passionate about fostering interdependence within formal groups
  and creating possibilities of flourishing as a unit. Not only do I choose to
  work on relationships within organizations but I am also keenly interested in
  relational ties within the family, be it couples or parent-child
  relationships. My ability to reach and connect with people eases the path of
  resolving human blocks within interpersonal and professional arenas. I make a
  non-judgmental and safe space for individuals in order to foster personal
  growth in different areas of life. "
