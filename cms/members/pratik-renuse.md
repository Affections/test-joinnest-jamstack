  "Over the last decade of working on several projects with several companies
  and at several geographies, I have realised that I thrive in the ""0 to 1""
  environment; of building something from nothing. Following are a few ventures,
  where I helped build from ground zero: - A startup named Infento in Amsterdam
  from 0 to 7 figures in online D2C sales - 2018's leading Kickstarter campaign
  in STEM category from idea to success - An EU wide project at Airbus, taken
  from conception to a 6 figure funding - Bayer's premier senior executives
  global event from scratch to deploying a €250K budget And a lot more other
  projects of various sizes. Musing upon these experiences, I realised that
  these were the domains wherein I enjoyed most and brought immense value into.
  Further, I went on to advise and mentor C level executives of successfully
  funded 7+ figure valuation startups across the USA, EU, Asia, and Africa; on
  building their startups to scaleups. Their testimonials on my profile and
  website (www.pratikrenuse.com) evince the value we built towards their
  companies, which again, now after reflecting back, I realise is a product of
  working where I thrive the most. Another area I relish and the results of
  which seem to create value for others, which in fact, is also quite
  intertwined with leadership, is coaching teams and graduates. Sharing my
  experiences, mistakes, and thereafter transforming the perspective of someone
  to believe in themselves is immensely fulfilling to me as the work I do. I was
  fortunate to coach over 50+ graduates from several universities such as
  Harvard, London School of Economics, IMD Switzerland, HEC Paris and a lot
  more."
