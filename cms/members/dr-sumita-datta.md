  Management & Industrial Relations from XLRI Jamshedpur (1992) with academic
  Concentration in Organization Behavior, I received my PhD. from IIT Bombay in
  2010. I’m a certified MBTI, Saville, EQi 2.0 and NLP Practitioner. Alongside
  I’m a certified Integral Coach of New Ventures West, USA and Associate

  time corporate experience of more than 15 years since 1992 during which I
  served as an HR Manager-Eveready Industries and Head HR- Corporate Centre,
  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. Since 2005, I have been actively engaged in
