What is love? This tiny four-letter word has millions of versions when we try to define it. However, I always had just one interpretation of this most over hyped feeling- Love is God, as simple as that. It’s the purest kind of feeling that is the glue between two souls. Where there is love there is acceptance, beauty, happiness- that only grows with the passage of time. Change, they say, is the only constant. True love proves this logic absolutely valid for it certainly changes as days, weeks, months and years go by. Closeness and feelings get stronger and stronger. Each day you fall in love all over again with a new strength and passion! Such is the grandeur of love.

  

Another gospel attached to love is that it’s free of envy, never boastful and perpetually giving! I, on the other hand, feel that it’s no sin to be stung by the monster of jealously once in a while. It does not show your lack of sentiment for your beloved; it rather gives an insight to the depth of your emotions. How can you love like a saint when you love with irrevocable passion? Let yourself out there. Scream, yell and be ridiculously unreasonable! Hold on real tight with the determination to never let go. It sometimes is the best present you can give your sweetheart- the feeling of being the center of your world. No rules or guidelines make sense to those in love. You may fight and argue all you want because at the end of the day, all that really matters is you stick to each other through thick and thin relentlessly, making all of it worth the while.

  

I don’t know when I fell in love. I don’t know how or why! How can you keep track over trivial things like the clock when the missing part of your soul is right there smilingly waiting for you to complete them?! How can you restrict yourself over worldly laws and restrictions? How can you ever let a third person come between you and be the judge to define what love should be like?! There are no spaces, no place for anyone and the splendor of such beautifully true love is that you never have to work on it. I always keep hearing and reading that relationships need hard work, compromise and sacrifice. How can you possibly have the time to think about all this when your heart, mind and soul already belong to your soul mate? How can you tag the things you do to make your best friend, your love smile, with pessimistic words like compromise and sacrifice? When you are in love you smile when the person you love is happy, you get motivated towards a better and happier life when your companion is standing beside you rock solid despite all odds and all this never needs any effort if your love is pure and true- it simply just happens! All you have to do is let go of all your inhibitions and let love happen.

  

“Fairytales are fictional non sense that’s rotting the minds of our youth today”- This is another pessimistic thought that’s staining the magnificence of a feeling as pure as love. Fairytales do come to life and can happen to you too but, you have to wait for your prince and not wear rosy glasses and keep falling for the frogs. In today’s day and age we surely can’t expect a knight wearing his shiny armor, riding on his royal steed come knocking at your door with a glass slipper and we definitely wont come across a pretty little princess trapped in the highest room in the tallest tower guarded by a fire breathing dragon, waiting eagerly to be rescued by her prince charming!  In real life such drama loses its way but the suave prince or the gorgeous princess will surely not. He/she will come silently into your life, be your best friend, give your life its missing colors and stability and you will never want to look back. Even in their physical absence, their emotional presence will give you the strength to sail through the most perilous storm successfully with a smile on your face. Your true love will inspire you even when you are grappling through the toughest and the most trying period with absolutely no hope. He/she, whether near or far, will be your guiding light in the darkness. That is the style statement of true love. It’s not the grand gestures of buying expensive presents but it’s the subtlety of understanding each others eyes and heartbeats that defines the bond of true love. It’s when you sit for hours together silently and feel like you’ve had the best and most fulfilling conversation that you know your bond is genuinely a magical one. It’s when you excitedly look forward to growing old together filling this mundane life with millions of charming memories that will bring a sparkle in your eyes even decades down the lane. It’s when you buy rogaine for him and he finds you spectacularly gorgeous in your pajamas on a bad hair day with a sneeze!

  

To sum it all up, love between two true hearts is the most divine and warm emotion that drenches down to your very soul where its fragrance will live forever. It’s way beyond this superficial world- Love is perfect in its imperfect ways.. it’s unconditional.
