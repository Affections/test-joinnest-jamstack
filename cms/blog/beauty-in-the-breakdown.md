“In order to rise from its own ashes, a Phoenix first must burn.”- by Octavia Butler.

  

Failure has such a stigma attached to it. Sure it is success that we must aim for, but why is falling down while trying to learn how to fly considered such a taboo? “Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall”- Confucius; and yet we try, inevitably fall & look at it as the end of the road rather than an exciting bend. Hence imprisoning ourselves in our self-proclaimed box of shame and closing the door to a whole new world of beautiful opportunities.

  

Michael Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players of all times. He is a living legend with unparalleled accomplishments- an epitome of hard work, dedication, commitment & optimism. From being an average player & facing rejection after being cut from his high school varsity basketball team sophomore year, to being refused sponsorship by one of the biggest brands for being “short” to finally becoming one of the most impactful players to ever grace the court- MJ, with sheer determination & faith in his potential managed to create history.

  

Here’s what he said about failure:

“I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot, and I missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeeded. I can accept failure, everyone fails at something; but I can’t accept not trying. If it turns out that my best wasn’t good enough, at least I won’t look back and say I was afraid to try.” Giving up was never an option for him. Every time he tasted failure, his passion to achieve his goal only fuelled his hunger for success. For him, limits, just like fear were mostly an illusion.

  

Michael Jordan is a man who knows his worth and he has shown the world what he is made of. He strongly believes that, “If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you never will change the outcome.” His inspirational journey from being persona non grata to an icon people all over the world worship, is a paradigm of true optimism. What a world it would be without a precious gem such as MJ, if he had simply quit at his first failure! Obstacles & failures are inescapable and rather a blessing in disguise because it is in overcoming these barriers that we develop grit and realise that growth comes from overcoming fears and not hiding away from them. Every mistake, every bump in the road, every breakdown provides you with tools to sharpen your strategy and level up your game.

  

Don’t dwell on the past. Be in the here & now allowing yourself to celebrate your achievements- big or small. Set goals; scheme a master plan but don’t worry about something that hasn’t happened yet. You might lose and you might be dragged down but that doesn’t mean you’re not good enough. It simply means you need to learn from your mistakes, tweak your plan and work harder while committing to relentlessly upgrading yourself. There is always room for improvement. Talents can be cultivated, failures can become your finest teachers and complete & utter dedication can be worth all the salty tears; the sky is never the limit- your vision is.
