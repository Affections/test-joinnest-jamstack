The human mind is the most sophisticated machine on earth. Supercomputers & many species enhancing inventions have come out of it. Our thinking capacity is superior to all other living beings on the planet & it’s a gift. At the peak of evolution, we possess the most complex neurological system & the highest level of cerebral capability. We have the power of a vivid sense of memory and a fantastic sense of imagination. But, unfortunately, we have mistaken this beautiful contrivance for our masters & have fallen prey to its commands, letting it control us rather than us control it, hence translating this pine blessing into a dreadful curse.

  

It took millions of years to get this brain to this size & now it has sadly become our enemy. 90% of humans are only suffering from their intelligence. We lose more than we gain when we let the little grey cells in our heads run amok. Thinking means exercising our thought process consciously. As soon as this outpour becomes unconscious it turns into mental diarrhoea. We create our world of illusions & then we fight them. We lose track of the fact that they are our thoughts and we must be able to throw them out & roll them back in as per our will- not the other way around. Only humans are called beings because only humans are capable of conscious existence which means that we’re capable of using every faculty that we have the way we want to by conscious response & not in reaction to what happens around us.

  

The present experience is important & how vivid is our imagination for tomorrow is also very important but right now the problem is that we have gotten these things all mixed up due to our lack of discipline of faculty, and as a result, our mind has turned against us. What happened 10 years ago, we still suffer. We carry the heavy cross of our past every moment of our life & remind ourselves every day of what could have been and could have gone differently. We plague our peace with anxieties of what may happen in our unborn future and make ourselves miserable and exhausted, all because there’s no discipline of faculty. Our unwarranted application of the 2 greatest faculties of being a human- vivid sense of memory & a fantastic sense of imagination, make us suffer & we wrongfully conclude that we’re suffering our life.

  

It is said we are what we think- our thoughts define our existence but I believe that we are much bigger than that. The clearest, sharpest & most serene state of mind is like a clear blue sky stretching into the distance. Think of all the thoughts & emotions like clouds in the sky. There are always a few clouds of thoughts & emotions in the sky of our mind. They could be bright & fluffy or dark & heavy blocking out all the light & stirring up a frenetic storm. But whether beautiful or destructive, these billows end up clouding our judgment. Sometimes we get so obsessed with the clouds that we forget about the blue sky altogether which is always there behind the clouds the entire time.

  

This is a perfect analogy about how we can easily forget that what we’re looking for, that quality of mind that serves us best, is always already there. We just need to practice to be able to look past the clouds or to give the clouds enough space to move through because clouds by their very nature always pass through. All we have to do is shift our focus to access the clarity of mind that exists behind these temporary shadows.

  

Every thought, every reverberation on the level of the mind has the power to change our whole chemistry and with increasing negativity arising from unnecessarily entertaining irrelevant thoughts, we’re poisoning our system from within. This constant creation of nasty chemistry will manifest in many ways in our body in the form of anxiety which is born out of worrying about something that hasn’t even happened, depression which is a consequence of being stuck in the past, fatigue, headache etc to name a few. Landing in such an unpleasant soup is the perfect precursor to long sleepless nights which will hamper our overall well-being even further.

  

Overthinking leads to wasted opportunities. It is the root of many problems and many mental problems have physical solutions. A combination of meditation, exercise, healthy dietary habits & structure, also known as discipline is the ultimate cure for overthinking. Sometimes, venting it all out, talking about those bubbling emotions & feeling like you’re not sailing alone is what it takes to feel lighter. Whether it’s your parent, sibling, best friend or a professional therapist, seeking a listening ear can do wonders. Ultimately we need to realise that the past cannot be changed hence it’s better to take the lessons generated by our life’s experiences with us to make better decisions in the future that is yet to be born & welcomed with cheer rather than fear. It takes efforts to form healthy habits but believe me it’s all worth it.
