“I love you”- the most commonly used line in today’s world. However, do we remember what it means anymore?

Relationships- they could be either a hub of happiness or a fountainhead of tears and despite all the history we learn, despite what we see around us, we’ll never really know which one of the above two options fit in best with us unless we see it for ourselves.

  

Family, friends or your special beloved; Can we pick one person to stand by us unconditionally? Can we, in our innocence, take the liberty to live our lives for once with a feeling of security of having that someone- the one person who’ll never judge us and only love & accept us for who and what we are? “Never change for I loved you for the person you are”– easier said than done. We may all expect this from those people we love and truly care about but who truly intends it?

  

Disagreement & argument is healthy at times… I feel a true relationship is the one that allows you to speak your heart with utmost ease. There is so much trust & understanding, such boundless love that you know for sure, even the silliest of tiff will only be a stepping-stone towards deeper attachment. Moreover, it is this confidence in each other that provides stronger roots for a healthier relationship.

  

Another gospel for rosier relationships is- communication. Undoubtedly, communication is the key to open the toughest of locks but the sad thing is that we often misunderstand “communication” for being “telecommunication” whereas the real meaning actually lies in replacing “tele” with “telepathic”. In any relationship, it is solely the communication between two hearts and souls that can be marked as a true form of communication. Just like a mother who, without making the slightest bit of effort, understands every word of her child’s alien language. Just like a truly loving wife who can easily sense the tension behind her husband’s smile. Just like a friend who knows you better than to judge you for your flakey attitude while you’re going through a rough patch in your life.

  

We all have plenty personalized relationships in our lives and we (mostly) invest many of our feelings in them and pay proper attention. Nevertheless, the one common bond that we all share with each other is the one we always forget. The one tie of humanity that binds us together is something that we are hardly concerned about anymore. Unfortunately, we weigh our relationships on the basis of color, caste, age & above all beauty. We have forgotten that we are mere souls trapped in this mortal body and despite the way we are on the outside, we are all the same from within. Our souls are little droplets that have evolved from the same source- Lord Almighty.

  

Are superficial relationships taking over the wheel putting true meaningful ones, that give life it’s ultimate meaning, in the backseat?
