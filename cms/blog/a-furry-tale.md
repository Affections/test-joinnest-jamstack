"Fetch!" I beckoned, while Sparkles bounded after his brand new chew toy- Miss Duckie- that my brother had recently bought for him. His face beamed with joy.

  

It was a breezy summer evening and we were revelling our sixth year with Sparkles- a male German Shepherd- over a picnic at his favourite dog park.

  

Seems like yesterday when my parents were super- over my dead body- against bringing a pet into our family. Mostly due to my mother's fear of dogs pertaining to a grisly childhood memory. But, we were never a pair of rule abiding children and one fine night, we sneaked our furry little friend in, hoping to keep his presence under covers forever!

  

Perhaps in our innocence, we never realised that forever is a long time and that our little secret would spring out barking in our faces very soon. Three days later came the day, which back then seemed like "Judgement Day" for me and my partner in "crime".

  

We had instantly fallen in love with Sparkles and were determined to keep him even if it meant that we be grounded for all of our summer holidays. But, much to our surprise, a fleeting look of trepidation was all that passed over our mum's face and we were subjected to nothing but a day long of deafening silence. Come that evening, our parents decided to go by faith and with a long list of rules we had successfully become proud owners of a cute little puppy.

  

It's hard to believe, but here we are six years later- together and tightly knit. The decision to keep Sparkles has indeed turned out to be one of the best ones, not only because of the joy he brings with his cute little antics but also because he's been such a great teacher of the simple things in life which we tend to simply pass by.

  

It’s human nature to strive for control, predict and be certain of the future. To yearn to know all the specifics of what lies ahead. Can you imagine how trite & banal life would turn out if we had a telescope into the future joys & surprises? Living in the moment; enjoying the present to the fullest- thats one of the lessons Sparkles has taught us. Never in our wildest dreams could we have dreamt of having our mum fall in love with a dog!

  

There are days when the hours just don't seem enough. I am rushing through tasks almost like a robot, yet beating myself up to hurry faster. Amidst the chaos, Sparkles- with his twinkling eyes and always something in his mouth to greet me with- reminds me to slow down. He grounds me and inspires me to be more cognisant.

  

When he moans & whines for me to walk him, although i grumble at first but, watching him sniff the trees or chase a butterfly on our trail, I feel a sense of contentment and without a care in the world, I realise that this very moment is all that matters.

One trip to the park, looking at him jump out of the car, bounce and hop through the grass, bursting with joy wanting to chase sticks and balls and play as if there's no tomorrow, reminds me just how refreshing it is to play, breathe in some fresh air, go with the flow and break the stiff pattern of working all the time.

  

Being a German Shepherd, Sparkles is hard-wired to herd and keep the pack together. His pack being, me and my family. Sometimes, to get him to exercise, we all run in different directions and he desperately runs back and forth trying to keep us all together. The metaphor here serves as a reminder of how important it is to stay connected with your pack- family, no matter how busy you get.

  

Sparkles has a natural capacity for compassion and forgiveness- human emotions forgotten by humans themselves. He feels another's pain as if it’s his own. I remember having a bitter argument with my brother once, wherein we both were boundlessly scornful. My brother was visiting from London only for a few days and I knew that I had upset him unnecessarily and that the right thing to do would be to comfort him and sweep my ego out of the way but instead I remained angry. Sparkles, on the other hand, sensed the tension and kept jumping between the two of us trying to get us to reconcile. He whimpered and perched his chin on our knees with longing eyes and licked our faces and although some dog experts may have a different theory on this, it still taught me a lot about love and compassion and that when in pain, holding on to a grudge is never the answer. This is something we must constantly strive to remember.

  

There is something special that every sunrise brings in with itself. The gift of a new day- a new chance for better beginnings. This is something that I am reminded of every morning when I look at Sparkles welcoming the day ecstatically. His tail goes crazy and he's practically bursting with the excitement of a little girl waking up to a room full of presents on her sweet sixteenth birthday. It inspires me to be thrilled to be alive!

He expresses the same enthusiasm when he is approached by a visitor at our home and again, although these traits may have a different evolutionary meaning from an expert's point of view, I for one have learnt multitudes of lessons from him and I'm ever so grateful.

  

I would be very remiss if I didn't mention how peaceful and comforting it is to pet a dog. Doesn't matter how angry, upset, nervous or confused I am, just brushing my fingers through Sparkles' fur, listening to him breathe and walking down the trail with him is all that I need to do to restore my fading spirit.
