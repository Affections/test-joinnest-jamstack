  All of a sudden I found myself lost in this labyrinth called life. I felt as

All of a sudden I found myself lost in this labyrinth called life. I felt as if the universe had conspired against me to tangle up the strings of my very being, abruptly disrupting the humming of it’s beautiful melody. It was a downward spiral from there on out. A force stronger than gravity- stronger than the strongest magnet, pulling me further into the dark abyss of hopelessness & despair.

  

Darkness. Sounds like a frightening place to be in, doesn’t it? With dangers lurking in the thick shadows of the verdure. Well, It was for me. At least until I befriended the naughty angel disguised as the witch from Hansel & Gretel who was out to sharpen my vision rather than bury my dreams. I found myself stuck in a web with spiders running all over me translating my vibrance into a mere shell of an existence, until one fateful night when it all started to come together.

  

I’ve never been one to simply give in or give up without a fight. I may fight back for an extra minute or two but never have I ever gone to bed with the regret of not trying enough- not fighting for it enough but, the set back that forcefully pushed me onto this horrifying roller coaster ride had now seduced me into the cave of discouragement and, although temporarily, dulled my sparkle and replaced it with bitterness & resentment. I felt cheated, i felt like God was not on my side. But there’s something so bolstering about having a hopeful mindset that I couldn’t stay in that state of self chosen oblivion for long.

  

An achiever of the outstanding excellence award year after year, an all-rounder with a popular presence at school and the apple of my parent’s eye- at age 10, I couldn’t have asked for more. Blessed with a beautiful family & oh! what a wonderful life. But destiny had a cruel prank in store for me. A simple infection neglected by the best of doctors, escalated into a life threatening disease leaving me & my family ravaged in the face of atrocities. Here i was, suddenly struggling to survive & win my life back. Upon the first victory begun my immediate struggle to break the barrier of paraplegia & work upon getting my voice back. It was an array of one struggle after the other. One setback eagerly overlapping the next. It broke my heart to see my once happy family grappling with the horrors each day kept unraveling for them. I could see the pain behind their forced smiles, I could sense their helplessness. It made me feel powerless. I was consumed with guilt; although i had nothing to do with anything that went down, i still felt like i was stealing my brother’s childhood & bringing pain into the beautiful home my parents had built for us with immense love and care. It was the perfect setting to give up hope & let life be hijacked by evil perpetrators out to get me & my own.

  

It had been three months since my traumatic 9 hour long surgery had been performed to extract parts of my bones eaten up by the infection for one whole year. Three months of endless nights & days, with innumerable medical opinions collected by my parents from all over the world, every single one suggesting my life was over & that my family must accept my bedridden future to finally move on with their lives but inspite of all the pessimistic feedback, my parents never lost hope. I had been provided with the best therapists all along who taught me simple skills to catalyse my recovery and although despondent, i felt like it was my responsibility to fight this battle for my family. So, i channelised the tattered shreds of my will power into practicing those skills and lo & behold, towards the end of that third month, my left toe finally flickered. None of my doctors believed it. It was a medical miracle- a very first they had seen in their long careers of 40-50 years. I was back. The long stormy night was finally coming to an end. A crisp & new day had dawned, bringing with it new hopes & aspirations.

  

When colossal struggles are entrusted upon us, boundless powers are silently instilled within us. The path gets foggy, our vision seems blurred & uncertainty engulfs us but hope gives us wings. Hope is like a stubborn best friend constantly whispering in our ears coaxing us to try one more time & give it one more chance when the world says give up. Relentlessly boosting our morale, bringing into focus the silver lining in the darkest of clouds. Pushing us into a mindset to simply show up, do our best with the promise that dawn will arrive.

  

I eventually found hope in my belief to successfully bring peace & joy back into my family and that motivated me to journey onwards with perseverance. Even though all odds were against us, my belief immediately made my goal clear & gradually, as i bravely started cutting the web of resignation i was entangled into, hope provided me with a map of the route to achieve my desired outcome. Although taking that first step was painfully difficult, the contentment, satisfaction & fulfilment it brought into my & my family’s life only made it all worthwhile. I finally found myself to be stronger, braver & more resilient than i ever was. The calm breeze of gratitude filled our lives with serenity.

  

Days will turn into nights & vice versa. The climate will change. It is inevitable. We have to simply decide whether we’re an admirer of the blanket of stars stretching to infinity or ignorant of the brightness of a ravishingly moonlit & star studded night. Whether we want to cherish the stunning painting of the sky by the golden fingers of sunlight or lock ourselves up in the gloomy prison of despair. Whether we wish to hide under a rock or fancy the rainbow at the end of every storm.

  

Hope opens doors to & equips one with endless possibilities. It conquers doubts & provides perspective. All we need to do is make the choice. Do we want our life to be a graveyard of buried hopes or do we want to leave a legacy of victories behind us? It is upto us to discover, unlock & embrace the highest potential we’re all inherently capable of.
